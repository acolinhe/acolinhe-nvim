# Anthony's Neovim Configuration

Welcome to my personal Neovim configuration!

## ðŸŒ² Directory Structure

Here's a brief overview of the important files and directories in this config:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ after
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ plugin     // Plugin-specific settings that are loaded after plugins are loaded
â”œâ”€â”€ init.lua       // The main Neovim configuration file
â”œâ”€â”€ lua
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ amanor     // Core configuration files and settings
â””â”€â”€ pack
    â”œâ”€â”€ github     // GitHub-related plugins, including GitHub copilot
    â””â”€â”€ packer     // The package manager used to manage plugins
```

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure you have [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) installed (version 0.5 or newer).
2. Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed for plugin management.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your Neovim configuration directory. Typically, this is `~/.config/nvim`:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/nvim-config ~/.config/nvim
   ```

2. Open Neovim:

   ```sh
   nvim
   ```

3. Install plugins:

   ```vim
   :PackerInstall
   ```

   This command will use the built-in `packer.nvim` to install and set up all the plugins listed in the configuration.


## ðŸ“œ Features

- **Plugin Management**: Using `packer.nvim` for lightweight and fast plugin management.
- **Custom Settings**: Various custom settings and key mappings for a personalized experience. Check out the `lua/amanor` directory for details.

## ðŸ“š Documentation

For more information about each specific configuration, refer to comments inside individual files. For example:

- `init.lua` - Main configuration file
- `lua/amanor/remap.lua` - Custom key mappings and shortcuts
- `lua/amanor/set.lua` - General Neovim settings and preferences

## ðŸ“£ Acknowledgements
